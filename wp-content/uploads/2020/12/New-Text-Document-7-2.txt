For example, when you are at school, maybe you want to be part of the cool kids, you want to be one of the popular group at school, but these kids all skip classes and don't do their classes and say bad words. But also, you want to please your parents and get good grades at school, so you try to do both at once. But the cool kids don't like you because you do your homework, and because you're trying to be cool, you don't do that well, you don't get good grades. That's a good example of how you can't please everyone.

But some people do try to please everyone, and those people are people pleasers. People pleasers can be very fun because, obviously, they like to make everyone happy, but they can't please everyone.

I used to be a bit of a people pleaser. I would have very different friends because I tried to be friends with everyone, and I changed myself, I changed my personality, to be friends with certain people.

This can lead to very strange situations when different groups of your friends meet and you realise they don't like each other, they have very different personalities, and you are the only thing between them. Apart from you, they have nothing in common, they have nothing the same. This has happened to me a few times.
