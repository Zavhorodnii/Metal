So, what is flash fiction? Flash fiction is very, very short fiction. So fiction is stories, novels and so on. Usually, flash fiction means a story that is 1000 words or less. In this case, I challenged my student to write a story in 500 words or less. So today's story was originally 500 words or less, but now it's more like 700 words, because I had to change the story for the podcast. I made it a bit longer so that I could make things clearer and easier to understand.

So why write flash fiction? Well, one, it's always fun to have a challenge, and when you're a writer, it's really good to try and challenge yourself every now and then. Sometimes you need to do something a bit different and see what happens.

So a twist is when something unexpected happens in a story. For example, in the film Star Wars, or-I don't know which Star Wars film. In the Star Wars series, there is a famous scene where Darth Vader-the guy in the black outfit with the red lightsaber-says, "Luke, I am your father." And that's a big twist, because before then, you don't know that Darth Vader is Luke's father! It's a big surprise. So that's an example of a twist, and today's story has a twist in it. But I won't spoil the twist, I won't tell you what the twist is!
