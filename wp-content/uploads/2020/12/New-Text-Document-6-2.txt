Every day, the elephants travelled together in search of food. Although elephants are the largest land animals in the world, they never attack others. They live in peace, travelling the wide savannahs and eating whatever they can find: fruit, grass and leaves.

Lucky quickly learned the ways of the herd. He helped out as much as he could, and always did what his mother and grandmother said. It was Sophia, Lucky's grandmother, who decided where the elephants would go. She knew the savannahs well, and remembered where to find clean water and fresh food, as well as how to avoid humans. All Lucky knew about those strange creatures was that they were dangerous.

So Lucky lived a cheerful life. In the evenings, he bathed with the other elephants and they threw dirt and sand at each other. In this way, they protected themselves from insects, as well as having a lot of fun. Lucky loved his life in the herd, and he wished it could always stay that way. But the day Lucky turned ten, his mother asked to speak to him.
