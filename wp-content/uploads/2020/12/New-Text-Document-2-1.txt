Chicago, the state of Illinois, is known as The Second City, which refers to its rebuilding after the fire. The current city is literally the second Chicago, after the one that disappeared in. It can also refer to the city's long-held position as the United States second largest city, after New York City.


Today, Chicago is called as The Windy City. You might suspect that Chicago got this nickname from the winds off Lake Michigan, which shove through the downtown corridors with intense force. But the true origin of the saying comes from politics. Some say it may have been coined by rivals like Cincinnati and New York as a derogatory reference to the Chicagoan endless political conventions. Others say that the term originated from the fact that Chicago politicians change their minds as "often as the wind."
